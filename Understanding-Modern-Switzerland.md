# Understanding Modern Switzerland

## From the Old Confederation to Modern Switzerland: The emergence of a national identity (1291-1848)

Switzerland was founded in several times (1291, 1884, 1891)

### Emergence of a Swiss Space (13th-16th C.)

#### Birth of 1291

The pact of 1291 and the official birth of Switzerland. The pact between communities Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden, which committed to give each other mutual support, but it's not a declaration of Independence (still controlled by the Habsburgs)

It was one of many other pacts in XIII Century.

Only in 1891 it was selected as official birth of Switzerland. It was selected as that in search of national identity validation; to celebrate nationalism and since it was preserved in good condition.

#### Switzerland role in European history

Switzerland in the pre-1848 period was "a buffer and border zone" between key European powers (Habsburg, France, Duchy of Burgundy, etc) and a crossroad (of cultures and of traderoutes).

Confoederatio Helvetica - CH - was part of Holy Roman Empire in XIV.

Swiss comes from canton name Schwyz.

Switzerland (what would be later) was crossroad for major trade routes - Gent to Venice, Leipzig to Lyon/Marseille. And people living in the mountains controlled mountain passes.

#### Switzerland growth and stop of growth

Swiss confederation was build by progressive alliances and conquests of territories over the centuries.
Three oldest cantons have woven complex network of permanent and temporary alliances
And it was progressive political affirmation against Habsburg emancipation.

After first three, the other cantons joined the alliance progressively throughout XIV, XV and start of XIV centuries. After 1513, there were no additions until XIX century.
This was because of the Battle of Marignano (1515) between French and Milan.

**Battle of Marignano:**

- Swiss mercenaries were defeated by French forces. After that there was a Peace Treaty in 1521.
- This resulted in
  - end of Swiss cantons foreign expansion
  - pre-emption rights on the hiring of Swiss mercenary regiments to Kingdom of France
  - France became "protector" of Swiss cantons until 1789

The Swiss mercenaries were forbidden from 1848, except in Vatican (Pope Guard). But otherwise there were popular hires outside and in Swiss cantons.

#### Protestant reformation

In XVI century there was a protestant reformation.

J. Calvin established a theocratic city-state in Geneva in 1541

Major civil wars and religious motivated wars erupted all across Europe.

Most **cities** were protestant and more **rural areas** were catholic. (division in 1536).

With the religious divide called into question the alliances of the Swiss cantons.

### The Old Confedereation during _Ancien Régime_ (17th - late 18th C.)

A lot of unequal political and power structures.
Social structures and economic development, enlightment.

Since 1513 the confederation was of 13 canton. (until 1798)
There are some teritories that were not cantons but still part of the confederation.
And there was no federal constitution for the whole confederation.

#### The "Diet" (_Ancien Régime_ assembly)

There was a representatives of cantons assembly. Each canton would send 1-2 delegates and Zurich (being one of the strongest cantons) were presiding the meeting.

It has nothing to do with the current democratic tradition.

#### Very messy situation

Switzerland was made out of 13 canton, but each of them had a different constitutional status.
Some cantons had connections aligned with some cantons, but not the others, borders were not aligned.

Delegates and canton controls were from strong families.

For many years Switzerland was a poor country and subject to emigration.

#### _Ancien Régime_ "proto-industry"

In XVIII century textile production in rural Eastern Switzerland.

Raw materials were transformed and home and/or in small production units.
Finished cloth then was brought back to the city to be sold on international markets.

Protestants who fled from France settled in Switzerland. They contributed to economic development because they came with their know-how. French settled in Basel came with textile production knowledge and people settled in Geneva contributed to watchmaking industry.

#### Conclusions of _Ancien Régime_

Deeply unequal structures and mostly rural society.

BUT society was on the move:

- demographic expansion
- economic expansio nand innovation
- new ideas began to spread: Enlightment ideas
  - mounting criticism of patrician priviliges, of church authority
  - demands for several freedoms

### "Age of Revolution" and the birth of Moder Switzerland (1799 - 1884)

#### What is it?

struggles for modern liberal democracy and economic liberalism against _Ancien Régime_
a revolutionary period lasting half century

Key events:
American revolution and independence has inspired Swiss political regime.
French invasion during Napoleonic wars.

#### Switzerland during the Revolutionary and Napoleanonic wars (1789-1815)

In 1798 France invaded Old Confederation, and it became Helvetic Republic as a "satelite state" of France.

Some people in Old Confederation saw France invasion as a positive thing, because of the change of mindset.

The invasion was done with some help of revolutionaries, and a paradox emerges - country unified by the foreign power.

After 1798 invasion republic became more equal system, more cantons were founded. By 1802 only cantons remained.

#### Turning point - 1815

Battle of Waterloo - defeat of Napoleon.

Switzerland was perceived as a great power as a buffer zone between Austrian empire and start of Swiss neutrality during Paris and Vienna Peace treaties.

#### Post-revolution

Conservative Swiss who want to keep the _Ancien Régime_ and more liberal Swiss who want to keep the new state introduced by France invasion.

#### 1848 - Foundation of the modern Swiss Confederation

Was not really peaceful reform - 1848 Federal Constitution was preceded by the civil war in 1847

#### Political state afterwards

There is not one president in Switzerland. There are 7 Federal Concilors.
The first ones were bourgois, only from one party (Freisinn (not the case today)), only men (women did not have a right to vote and participate in federal council until 1977)

In 1848 Switzerland made its bourgois revolution - birth of modern Switzerland.

#### National-state construction around 1900

In 1848 federal constitution.

And until mid XX century there are a lot of reorganizational and nationalization changes made (national railway, federal tax system, ETHZ established etc.)

#### Why choose 1291 and not 1848 for the birth

Ofers long and glorious past (600 years in 1891)
Aboids the conflictuals past
Neutralizes division and cleavages

An example of selective and political use of history.

## Cultural diversity and Political Integration

### Cultural diversity - two major dimensions

Small country, vut important cultural diversity

Religion - protestant vs catholic

Linguistic - german, italian, french, romansch

#### Religious cleavages

Main cities of CH happened turned protestant 16th century

Only few other cantons (primitive ones) remained catholic

Mid 19th century around 40% of the population was catholic. And in 1847 the Sonderbund war was fought between the catholics and the protestants.
After the civil war, protestants could impose the federal constitution in 1848

There was a **kulturkampf** (cultural struggle) during the second half of the 19th century.
Religious issues stemmed from education - catholic cantons had schools given by the church, protestant cantons - state schools

And the religious divergence declined in the last part of the 19th century, and there was a reform of the federal Constitution of 1874 and election of a catholic conservative federal council

Today the religious issue is much less relevant.

In the recent times, proportion of "No Affiliation" grew in the last 30 years.

#### Linguistic Cleavages

Much less dividing political issue during the 19th century.

The German speaking part represents a clear majority, but other languages hold the other ~40%

(1950-1970s there was a big immigration from Italy) - this was a time of major economic growth of Switzerland

Linguistic cantonal autonomy is guaranteed by the constitutional principle of **teritoriality** - means each canton is responsible for the use of its language in the canton. It's used to protect the linguistic minority in the canton

3 official bilingual cantons - FR, BE, VS, and trilingual canton - Grisons

**Linguistic tensions/difficulties**:

- failed integration - Jura Canton (26th canton, created 1979)
  - initially part of Bern, then separatist movement (by French minority) to create a new canton. There was a division between French separatists and French-speaking loyalists (who wanted to stay in Bern). So there was a Jura Canton created without one of the communities that stayed in Bern.
- Recent period - new tensions
  - "Rostigraben" since 1992 - separation of the rosti (a potato dish).
  - This was the issue from the vote of joining the European Economic Area, where there was a half divide - 49.7 for (concentrated in French speaking, and Basel city+outside), 50.3 against (in popular vote) - 6+2/2 for and 14+4/2 against. The rest of the German part and Ticcino refused to join.
  - This is influenced by the perception of EU from the Swiss people. French population had a more positive outlook, and the German-speaking part were more sceptical about EU, and the influence of Germany.
  - 10 years later there was a bilateral agreement between the EU and Switzerland. One central part is the free movement of people to work in either area.

Also - a debate on what second language taught at school should be. The usual - German for French-speaking, French for German-speaking. There were tensions when some cantons voted to have Englsih before French

**How do Swiss people communicate with each other**:
one person switches to the language of the other (in the informal context) - relatively rare because you need to be fluent in both languages

Each person speaks their language and is supposed to understand the other language (very often the case in formal contexts, and the national or intercantonal levels)

Or the speak English (... but are not proud of it) e.g. in scientific national meetings of politics or something else

The people do not really know each other in other cantons

### Switzerland as a Paradigmatic Case of Political Integration

Wh yis it possible to have peacefull cohabitation and national integration in a such diverse country? - because between religious and linguistinc cleavages; political institutions are favorable to power-sharing and political integration.

#### How it was built

The political unification in 1848, made emergence for common sentiments (political) of nationhood

**Major political institutions, which favored political integration**:

1. Federalism
2. Proportional representation
3. Direct democracy

### Federalism

Federalism was a _institutional compromise_ between both sides in 1848

There are 3 levels to Swiss democracy - Federal, Cantonal, and Communcal levels

Built with a bottom-up construction - Subsidiarity principle

**Communes** - have limited power to organize themselves, have government and parliament or citizens assembly; are financially strong (~25% of tax revenue)

**Cantons** - have power to organize themselves (own constitutions), have paraliaments, governments and courts; Implement their own but also most of federal laws; are financially strong (~40% of tax revenue)

**Bicameral Legislature/Parliament**:

- National Council (200 seats)
- Council of States (46)
- both are equal power

Double majority for Constitutional amendment - the people and the cantons
Implication of cantos in federal decision-making
Central role of cantons in the implementation of some federal policies.

#### Parliament - the National Council

It is representation of the People

200 members
Seats distributed among cantons according to population
Elections (every 4 years), based on principle of proportionality since 1919

#### Parliament - the Council of States

It is the representation of the Cantons

46 members

Two representatives per canton
Elected every 4 years according to system determined by canton
Equal weight and competencies as National Council.

#### Executive - Federal Council

7 members - Ministers

Elected by Federal Assembly for 4 years
Rotating Presidency (each year)
Speask with one voice (principle of collegiality)
Each member is head of one ministry

## Swiss political system and its major political institutions

### Proportional representation

**Proportional electroral system** for the National Council since 1919 and earlier in the cantoms themselves.

Cantos are Electoral districs + Seats in the NC per canton are attributed according to the population size

Proportional representation favors small parties and is more representatitve of votes expressed

It is by rule of majority election in single member district - 2 rounds, the first round is won by 2 or 3 candidates and the second round is won by one

Composition of federal instances according to proportional representation (language, regions, parties, ...): Federal Council, Supreme Court (**Unwritten rule**)

Widespread principle that applies not only to the political authorities but also to the administration, interest groups, etc

**This favors power-sharing instead of majoritarian decision**

### Instruments of direct democracy

"country of direct democracy"

In no other country, direct demacracy has such a **structuring impact** on national politics.

**There are three different instruments**:

1. **Compulsory referendum** for constitutional amendment and important international treaties (1848 and 1977)
2. **Optional referendum** every decision by the Parliament can be brought to the poll if 50k citizens sign the referendum within 100 days (1874)
3. **Constitutional popular initiative** - 100k signatures are required in 18 months (1891)

#### Examples of popular initiatives refused by the citizens

- 1989 - Switzerland without Army - no = 64.4%
- 2009 - 6 Weeks of Holiday for everybody - no = 66.5%
- 2013 - Direct election of the Federal Council by the People - No = 76.3%

Other initiatives:

- Ban the construction of Minarets in Switzerland (2009)
- Extradition of Criminal Foreigners (Accepted in 28.11.2010)
- Against mass immigration (accepted 02.2014, only 50.3% yes)

### The structuring impact of direct democracy on Swiss politics

#### Popular initiative

very few popular initiatives have been accepted, but change over time

Popular initative - innovative dimension, also openness of Swiss political system and favorable to changes

**Indirect impact** of the initiative - impulses for partial reforms in the direction of the goals of the initiative (e.g. counter-proposal by Federal Council)

#### Optional referendum

**Referendum** - veto dimension, braking reforms, interven at the end of decision-making process (=veto point)

**Indirect impact** of referendum:

1. political integration of oppositional forces
2. development of the pre-parliamentary phase of the decision-making process in order to find compromises (= consultation of potential opponents)

### Different phases of political integration - from "Kulturkampf" and class struggle to political integration

#### Kulturkampf

There were numerous tensions between protestants and catholics in 19th cetury

1848-1891 - several successful referendums launched by Catholic conservatives against proposals by the majoritarian Radical-protestants

Declining importance of religious issues during the last quarter of the 19th century resulted in the first catholic-conservative in the Federal Council (1891)

#### Class struggle -> political integration

After religion in the 19th century, class conflict became the most salient political cleavage.
Numerous social conflicts at the beginning of the 20th century - **General Strike of 1918**

From political tensions to political stability/integration:

1. progressive pacification of labor relations ("Labor peace agreements" of 1937)
2. Integration of the social democratic party in the Federal Council (1943)

#### General strike of 1918

Main Demands:

- introduction of proportional representation for the elections in the National council
- reduction of working hours to 48 hours per week
- introduction of pension insurance
- right to vote for women

strikers were defeated but can also interpreted as a "victory of the losers"

### Major political parties and the composition on the Federal Council

- PLR/FDP « parti libéral-radical » (german FDP) (1894): Radicals + Liberal (formal merger in 2009)
- PDC/CVP (1912): Catholic-conservative, Christiandemocratic Party
- PSS/SPS (1888): Social-democratic Party
- UDC/SVP (1919): Swiss people Party (Former Farmer and small business party)

- Strong cantonal roots + Weakness of parties at the federal level
- Composition of Parliament and Government: sildes
- **Exceptional political stability** in the composition of the Parliament and the Government

## Parliament elections

### Results of federal elections 2023

#### Participation rate

It was 46.6% this year.

Why is it low?

Swiss regularly go to vote (There are around 4 voting times per year.), and if they are not satisfied with the parliament, they can express their vote in the referendums.

Because of the stability of the political climate, people are not inclined to vote.

But this time it does not really apply, because it was the first time former christian democrats, now le centre overtook the radicals (by one seat). And because of that, they can ask for one more seat in the government at the cost of radicals seat.

#### Which parties can be considered as the winners/losers of the elections 2023?

Le centre could be considered winners, because of the overtaking of radicals.

The green parties lost some seats at the cost of Swiss People's Party.
Why?

- Lack of energy resources in Europe
- the war in Ukraine affecting the energy prices.
- Also, that the demonstrations of green militants generated some anger among swiss citizens who didn't want to vote for them anymore.
- The main topics of the campaign were not about day-to-day citizen problems (inflation)
- other parties also include some elements of climate/environment preoccupation ideas in their programs
- there could be a correlation with the fact that greens had more pro-european agenda, and swiss people party had anti-european agenda.

One reason for the radical democratic party bad result is bancrupcy of Credit Suisse, which was closely related to the party.

#### What were their main arguments?

#### What can explain these results?

Why swiss people's party is first?

- conservative attitude
- increase of immigration
- uncertainty of world political climate
- during the crises the tendancy is that right-wing gets more popularity

Long term evolution is that main parties - radicals, soc-democrats, and christians were main ones from 1920s to 1990s, then right-wing dropped when swiss people's party got more votes with a slight decline of soc-democrats, and then the greens came into the mix.

#### Why is the composition of the Parliament not complete yet?

There are still second rounds for some cantons, e.g. Vaud. For the council of states (where there are 2 seats per canton). You need an absolute majority to get elected.

For the proportional election of the national council, there are no second rounds.

#### Will this new composition affect the election of the Federal Council next December?

There are 2 rules that are clashing:

- no residing federal councilor can be removed, and it only can happen if they resign themselves. Ignaccio Cassis (from radical party) does not have a high popularity, so they might be pressured to resign.
- The centre has more seats than radical right. (but the leader of the party has already said that they will not attack the swiss people's party seat)

So no, it will not.

**How does Federal Council election take place**:
it takes place every 4 years after the general election (after the second round as well). (in some cases there is a federal councelor who resigns during the term).
During a year of general election, some old federal councelor resigns before the election to drive attention to the new candidates.
Every individual is elected one after another, from the oldest to the youngest/newest.

**Who elects the federal council**:
federal assembly - (national council and federal council).
You need a majority to get a seat at the federal council, so there can be negotiations.

In 2003, a councelor was not reelected, and Swiss people's party gained a seat.

In 2007, "the night of the long knife" happened, Swiss people's party gained seats at the national council, but majority did not reelect one of their federal council representative. Instead they elected not the leader of the Swiss people's party, but less right-winged, unknown woman that was not even in the parliament.
When she accepted the election, she got kicked out by her party (because she betrayed her party), and resigned after 2 electoral cycles.

#### Is there any limit for money to spend on ads?

2 years ago there was no regulation on funding and transparency of the campaigning.

Now there is a law that regulates funding of the political campaign for the election and for the popular votes.
Subsidies of more than 5 or 10k CHF, have to be public.
(e.g. Philipp Morris subsidized radical party and swiss people's party)

### Synthesis - "Concordance Democracy" in the Shadow of the Referendum

Progressive integration of major oppositional forces in government (referendum + proportional representation in NC (from 1919))

Increasing importance of pre-parliamentary negotiations of decision-making process (importance to consult potential opponents about referendums)

=> Structuring impact of direct democracy on Swiss politics

**Paradox of Swiss politics** - direct democracy has led to "elites negotiation"

_Switzerland is peaceful not because of its people but because of its institutions (W.Linder)_

### Overview of Swiss politics in four phases

#### 1848-1918 German and radical hegemony

Constitutional revision in 1874
1891 Formal integration of the Catholics in the FC
And then the rise of class struggle with left/right divide - 1918 General strike as the high point

#### 1919-1959 - Bourgois block vs political left

1919 - proportional electoral system - end of radical domination

Integration of the left

#### 1959-1990s - the high-point of "Concordance Democracy"

1959-2003 - "Magic Formula" stabilizes the Federal Council (222 - three largest parties, 1- for the forth)

after 1945 economic growth and political stability

1970s-1980s new political actors Greens (left), and later right-wing populism of UDC/SVP

#### 1990s-today new polarizations

1990s-2000s polarization of the right/left debate

electoral success of the swiss peoples party (SVP) -> 2 reps in FC

since 2003 instability of the Federal Council.

#### Decision making process - 5 phases

1. Agenda-setting and initiation of reforms (could be in the parliament, could be elsewhere)
2. Pre-parliamentary phase: extra-parliamentary
   commissions + formal consultation procedures (involvement of the different actors - experts, parliamentary commissions)
3. Parliamentary phase: debates in parliamentary
   commissions and in plenary sessions
4. Direct-democratic phase, if referendum (law can be refused and you can start again)
5. Implementation phase

- It is  **Very lengthy** decision-making process
- With slow and incremental changes
- Pre-parliamentary phase considered as the most
  important, but revalorisation of the Parliament since
  the 1990s

### Role of interest groups in Swiss politics

One important thing - business associations and economic interest groups were organized very early in Swiss politics (even before some parties).

Major economic interest groups:

1. Economiesuisse (1870) - was even called an 8th federal council
2. USAM (1879) - Swiss Association of Small business
3. Swiss farmers' association (1897)
4. Swiss Federation of Trade Unions (1880)

All of them were subsidized by federal administration to provide statistics and provide some public tasks.

Other interest groups - consumer organizations, environmental groups.

#### Why are these groups so influential?

These groups usually have bigger financial resources than the political parties + they have large membership (usually larger than the political party as well) + they have more specific expertise in social policies or their fields.

These groups have close implecation in political decsion-making process (pre-parliamentary phase)

Weakness of political parties and late/unachieved professionalisation of the Parliament (kind of "militia Parliament") - there was no way to have an earning by being a member as a professional parliamentarian <- this was for a very long time until 1990s. (now it's a semi-professional parliament)

Close connections with political parties.

## The Economy of Switzerland: The Rise of a "Small Economic Power"

### Rise of "small economic power"

Despite its smallness, Switzerland has become a medium size economic power: 0.012% of world population, but 1.8% world trade (2010).

When did it become one of the wealthiest nations?
It had a lot of emigration, and now immigration.

The emergence of Swiss economic growth was initially in the second half of the 19th century and then in the first half (WW1 and 2) of the 20th century it grew very fast.

Many Swiss left to the US and South America looking to earn better living - there was a lot of emigration.
The change from emigration to imigration mainly happened in the second half of 19th century. Numerous swiss companies were created by immigrants. For example, Rolex was created by an English-German, Nestle by German man, ABB - founded by Brown (English) and Boveri (German), merged with Swedish Asea (it is an engineering firm)

#### Brief history background

Early-industrial revolution - (proto-industrialization) during 18th century (textile + watch industry)
Second industrial revolution (end of 19th century) - machine and chemical industry (swatch, Schindler elevators, Shultze, Zurich insurance company)

The Financial place started beginning of the 20th century (WW1) (also every canton has a publicly-owned bank)

Few natural resources - import of raw materials transformed in high value-added products
One of the natural resources - water - known as fountain of Europe (from which hidroelectric plants).

At the begining Swiss industry didn't have any pattents in world technologies, so the companies relied on the immitation of German or English pattents. Once the companies became mature and experts in their fields, Switzerland introduced federal pattent law (to protect themselves) and then Switzerland became the inovation country.

Looking through history:
Manufacturing secotr was the biggest one from the end of 19th century to mid 20th, where it was overtaken by service sector and the agriculture declined to 2%.

### Some major characteristics of the Swiss economy

#### Diversified economic structure

It is not only banks, mainy ecocnomic sectors:

- industry:
  - chemical-pharmaceuticals
  - machines/engineering
  - watchmatking (swatch, patec-philippe)
- Services:
  - banking
  - insurance
  - tourism

It is regionally diversified economic structure:

- textiles - north-east
- banking and financial centres - Zurich, Geneva, Lugano
- Watches and micromechanics - west - Jurax region
- Machines and metallurgy - canton of Zurich, and north
- Chemical and pharmaceuticals - Basel
- Electricity generation and tourism - Alps
- Life sciences and bio-medical - around Lausanne and lake Geneva

Dual structure of the Swiss economy:

- export-oriented sectors (major industrial sectors + banking and insurance, among which large multinational companies) - it is one of the most internationalized countries in Europe - share of export in relation to GDP and share of international investments in relation to GDP
- domestic oriented sectors (agriculture, construction, small and medium-sized companies)

Until mid 1990s, Swiss was one of the most protective countries in agriculture.

#### Export orientation of the swiss economy

It is small domestic market - early export orientation and specialization in high-value added products - Swiss com

Share of exports in relation to GDP - more than 50% of GDP

Close trade relations with Europe (around 50% of total swiss exports)

Sharp expansion of foreign direct investment (FDI) during the recent period and employees abroad.

Potential conflict between export industry and banking industry - exports want to sell for lower price and banking industry want the franc to be strong.
--> Solution - export industry is focusing on quality of the product, therefore the price does not really matter

#### Labour market

Low unemployment - dedicated workforce, and imported workforce with temporary work contracts (Italians, Spanish) until 1990s where they had more permanent contracts

Collective agreements and peaceful labour movements - virtually no strikes since the 1950s

High proportion of foreign workers (25% of active population)

### Tentative explanations for economic success

Cultural dimension - strong work ethic related to protestantism - high participation rate in labour market (plus an example of popular vote refusing 6 weeks of holidays)

Political-institutional factors - institutions that promote the collaboration between economic actors and social stability (aprenticeship programs, bank-industry relation, social partnership)

Early export oriented development - make export quality and strategic importance of neutrality during war time.
