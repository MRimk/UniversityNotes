# Understanding Modern Switzerland

## From the Old Confederation to Modern Switzerland: The emergence of a national identity (1291-1848)

Switzerland was founded in several times (1291, 1884, 1891)

### Emergence of a Swiss Space (13th-16th C.)

#### Birth of 1291

The pact of 1291 and the official birth of Switzerland. The pact between communities Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden, which committed to give each other mutual support, but it's not a declaration of Independence (still controlled by the Habsburgs)

It was one of many other pacts in XIII Century.

Only in 1891 it was selected as official birth of Switzerland. It was selected as that in search of national identity validation; to celebrate nationalism and since it was preserved in good condition.

#### Switzerland role in European history

Switzerland in the pre-1848 period was "a buffer and border zone" between key European powers (Habsburg, France, Duchy of Burgundy, etc) and a crossroad (of cultures and of traderoutes).

Confoederatio Helvetica - CH - was part of Holy Roman Empire in XIV.

Swiss comes from canton name Schwyz.

Switzerland (what would be later) was crossroad for major trade routes - Gent to Venice, Leipzig to Lyon/Marseille. And people living in the mountains controlled mountain passes.

#### Switzerland growth and stop of growth

Swiss confederation was build by progressive alliances and conquests of territories over the centuries.
Three oldest cantons have woven complex network of permanent and temporary alliances
And it was progressive political affirmation against Habsburg emancipation.

After first three, the other cantons joined the alliance progressively throughout XIV, XV and start of XIV centuries. After 1513, there were no additions until XIX century.
This was because of the Battle of Marignano (1515) between French and Milan.

**Battle of Marignano:**

- Swiss mercenaries were defeated by French forces. After that there was a Peace Treaty in 1521.
- This resulted in
  - end of Swiss cantons foreign expansion
  - pre-emption rights on the hiring of Swiss mercenary regiments to Kingdom of France
  - France became "protector" of Swiss cantons until 1789

The Swiss mercenaries were forbidden from 1848, except in Vatican (Pope Guard). But otherwise there were popular hires outside and in Swiss cantons.

#### Protestant reformation

In XVI century there was a protestant reformation.

J. Calvin established a theocratic city-state in Geneva in 1541

Major civil wars and religious motivated wars erupted all across Europe.

Most **cities** were protestant and more **rural areas** were catholic. (division in 1536).

With the religious divide called into question the alliances of the Swiss cantons.

### The Old Confedereation during _Ancien Régime_ (17th - late 18th C.)

A lot of unequal political and power structures.
Social structures and economic development, enlightment.

Since 1513 the confederation was of 13 canton. (until 1798)
There are some teritories that were not cantons but still part of the confederation.
And there was no federal constitution for the whole confederation.

#### The "Diet" (_Ancien Régime_ assembly)

There was a representatives of cantons assembly. Each canton would send 1-2 delegates and Zurich (being one of the strongest cantons) were presiding the meeting.

It has nothing to do with the current democratic tradition.

#### Very messy situation

Switzerland was made out of 13 canton, but each of them had a different constitutional status.
Some cantons had connections aligned with some cantons, but not the others, borders were not aligned.

Delegates and canton controls were from strong families.

For many years Switzerland was a poor country and subject to emigration.

#### _Ancien Régime_ "proto-industry"

In XVIII century textile production in rural Eastern Switzerland.

Raw materials were transformed and home and/or in small production units.
Finished cloth then was brought back to the city to be sold on international markets.

Protestants who fled from France settled in Switzerland. They contributed to economic development because they came with their know-how. French settled in Basel came with textile production knowledge and people settled in Geneva contributed to watchmaking industry.

#### Conclusions of _Ancien Régime_

Deeply unequal structures and mostly rural society.

BUT society was on the move:

- demographic expansion
- economic expansio nand innovation
- new ideas began to spread: Enlightment ideas
  - mounting criticism of patrician priviliges, of church authority
  - demands for several freedoms

### "Age of Revolution" and the birth of Moder Switzerland (1799 - 1884)

#### What is it?

struggles for modern liberal democracy and economic liberalism against _Ancien Régime_
a revolutionary period lasting half century

Key events:
American revolution and independence has inspired Swiss political regime.
French invasion during Napoleonic wars.

#### Switzerland during the Revolutionary and Napoleanonic wars (1789-1815)

In 1798 France invaded Old Confederation, and it became Helvetic Republic as a "satelite state" of France.

Some people in Old Confederation saw France invasion as a positive thing, because of the change of mindset.

The invasion was done with some help of revolutionaries, and a paradox emerges - country unified by the foreign power.

After 1798 invasion republic became more equal system, more cantons were founded. By 1802 only cantons remained.

#### Turning point - 1815

Battle of Waterloo - defeat of Napoleon.

Switzerland was perceived as a great power as a buffer zone between Austrian empire and start of Swiss neutrality during Paris and Vienna Peace treaties.

#### Post-revolution

Conservative Swiss who want to keep the _Ancien Régime_ and more liberal Swiss who want to keep the new state introduced by France invasion.

#### 1848 - Foundation of the modern Swiss Confederation

Was not really peaceful reform - 1848 Federal Constitution was preceded by the civil war in 1847

#### Political state afterwards

There is not one president in Switzerland. There are 7 Federal Concilors.
The first ones were bourgois, only from one party (Freisinn (not the case today)), only men (women did not have a right to vote and participate in federal council until 1977)

In 1848 Switzerland made its bourgois revolution - birth of modern Switzerland.

#### National-state construction around 1900

In 1848 federal constitution.

And until mid XX century there are a lot of reorganizational and nationalization changes made (national railway, federal tax system, ETHZ established etc.)

#### Why choose 1291 and not 1848 for the birth

Ofers long and glorious past (600 years in 1891)
Aboids the conflictuals past
Neutralizes division and cleavages

An example of selective and political use of history.

## Cultural diversity and Political Integration

### Cultural diversity - two major dimensions

Small country, vut important cultural diversity

Religion - protestant vs catholic

Linguistic - german, italian, french, romansch

#### Religious cleavages

Main cities of CH happened turned protestant 16th century

Only few other cantons (primitive ones) remained catholic

Mid 19th century around 40% of the population was catholic. And in 1847 the Sonderbund war was fought between the catholics and the protestants.
After the civil war, protestants could impose the federal constitution in 1848

There was a **kulturkampf** (cultural struggle) during the second half of the 19th century.
Religious issues stemmed from education - catholic cantons had schools given by the church, protestant cantons - state schools

And the religious divergence declined in the last part of the 19th century, and there was a reform of the federal Constitution of 1874 and election of a catholic conservative federal council

Today the religious issue is much less relevant.

In the recent times, proportion of "No Affiliation" grew in the last 30 years.

#### Linguistic Cleavages

Much less dividing political issue during the 19th century.

The German speaking part represents a clear majority, but other languages hold the other ~40%

(1950-1970s there was a big immigration from Italy) - this was a time of major economic growth of Switzerland

Linguistic cantonal autonomy is guaranteed by the constitutional principle of **teritoriality** - means each canton is responsible for the use of its language in the canton. It's used to protect the linguistic minority in the canton

3 official bilingual cantons - FR, BE, VS, and trilingual canton - Grisons

**Linguistic tensions/difficulties**:

- failed integration - Jura Canton (26th canton, created 1979)
  - initially part of Bern, then separatist movement (by French minority) to create a new canton. There was a division between French separatists and French-speaking loyalists (who wanted to stay in Bern). So there was a Jura Canton created without one of the communities that stayed in Bern.
- Recent period - new tensions
  - "Rostigraben" since 1992 - separation of the rosti (a potato dish).
  - This was the issue from the vote of joining the European Economic Area, where there was a half divide - 49.7 for (concentrated in French speaking, and Basel city+outside), 50.3 against (in popular vote) - 6+2/2 for and 14+4/2 against. The rest of the German part and Ticcino refused to join.
  - This is influenced by the perception of EU from the Swiss people. French population had a more positive outlook, and the German-speaking part were more sceptical about EU, and the influence of Germany.
  - 10 years later there was a bilateral agreement between the EU and Switzerland. One central part is the free movement of people to work in either area.

Also - a debate on what second language taught at school should be. The usual - German for French-speaking, French for German-speaking. There were tensions when some cantons voted to have Englsih before French

**How do Swiss peopl communicate with each other**:
one person switches to the language of the other (in the informal context) - relatively rare because you need to be fluent in both languages

Each person speaks their language and is supposed to understand the other language (very often the case in formal contexts, and the national or intercantonal levels)

Or the speak English (... but are not proud of it) e.g. in scientific national meetings of politics or something else

The people do not really know each other in other cantons
