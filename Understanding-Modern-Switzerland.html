<p>Switzerland was founded in several times (1291, 1884, 1891)</p>
<h3 id="emergence-of-a-swiss-space-13th-16th-c.">Emergence of a Swiss
Space (13th-16th C.)</h3>
<h4 id="birth-of-1291">Birth of 1291</h4>
<p>The pact of 1291 and the official birth of Switzerland. The pact
between communities Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden, which committed to give
each other mutual support, but it’s not a declaration of Independence
(still controlled by the Habsburgs)</p>
<p>It was one of many other pacts in XIII Century.</p>
<p>Only in 1891 it was selected as official birth of Switzerland. It was
selected as that in search of national identity validation; to celebrate
nationalism and since it was preserved in good condition.</p>
<h4 id="switzerland-role-in-european-history">Switzerland role in
European history</h4>
<p>Switzerland in the pre-1848 period was “a buffer and border zone”
between key European powers (Habsburg, France, Duchy of Burgundy, etc)
and a crossroad (of cultures and of traderoutes).</p>
<p>Confoederatio Helvetica - CH - was part of Holy Roman Empire in
XIV.</p>
<p>Swiss comes from canton name Schwyz.</p>
<p>Switzerland (what would be later) was crossroad for major trade
routes - Gent to Venice, Leipzig to Lyon/Marseille. And people living in
the mountains controlled mountain passes.</p>
<h4 id="switzerland-growth-and-stop-of-growth">Switzerland growth and
stop of growth</h4>
<p>Swiss confederation was build by progressive alliances and conquests
of territories over the centuries. Three oldest cantons have woven
complex network of permanent and temporary alliances And it was
progressive political affirmation against Habsburg emancipation.</p>
<p>After first three, the other cantons joined the alliance
progressively throughout XIV, XV and start of XIV centuries. After 1513,
there were no additions until XIX century. This was because of the
Battle of Marignano (1515) between French and Milan.</p>
<p><strong>Battle of Marignano:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Swiss mercenaries were defeated by French forces. After that there
was a Peace Treaty in 1521.</li>
<li>This resulted in
<ul>
<li>end of Swiss cantons foreign expansion</li>
<li>pre-emption rights on the hiring of Swiss mercenary regiments to
Kingdom of France</li>
<li>France became “protector” of Swiss cantons until 1789</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The Swiss mercenaries were forbidden from 1848, except in Vatican
(Pope Guard). But otherwise there were popular hires outside and in
Swiss cantons.</p>
<h4 id="protestant-reformation">Protestant reformation</h4>
<p>In XVI century there was a protestant reformation.</p>
<p>J. Calvin established a theocratic city-state in Geneva in 1541</p>
<p>Major civil wars and religious motivated wars erupted all across
Europe.</p>
<p>Most <strong>cities</strong> were protestant and more <strong>rural
areas</strong> were catholic. (division in 1536).</p>
<p>With the religious divide called into question the alliances of the
Swiss cantons.</p>
<h3
id="the-old-confedereation-during-ancien-régime-17th---late-18th-c.">The
Old Confedereation during <em>Ancien Régime</em> (17th - late 18th
C.)</h3>
<p>A lot of unequal political and power structures. Social structures
and economic development, enlightment.</p>
<p>Since 1513 the confederation was of 13 canton. (until 1798) There are
some teritories that were not cantons but still part of the
confederation. And there was no federal constitution for the whole
confederation.</p>
<h4 id="the-diet-ancien-régime-assembly">The “Diet” (<em>Ancien
Régime</em> assembly)</h4>
<p>There was a representatives of cantons assembly. Each canton would
send 1-2 delegates and Zurich (being one of the strongest cantons) were
presiding the meeting.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the current democratic tradition.</p>
<h4 id="very-messy-situation">Very messy situation</h4>
<p>Switzerland was made out of 13 canton, but each of them had a
different constitutional status. Some cantons had connections aligned
with some cantons, but not the others, borders were not aligned.</p>
<p>Delegates and canton controls were from strong families.</p>
<p>For many years Switzerland was a poor country and subject to
emigration.</p>
<h4 id="ancien-régime-proto-industry"><em>Ancien Régime</em>
“proto-industry”</h4>
<p>In XVIII century textile production in rural Eastern Switzerland.</p>
<p>Raw materials were transformed and home and/or in small production
units. Finished cloth then was brought back to the city to be sold on
international markets.</p>
<p>Protestants who fled from France settled in Switzerland. They
contributed to economic development because they came with their
know-how. French settled in Basel came with textile production knowledge
and people settled in Geneva contributed to watchmaking industry.</p>
<h4 id="conclusions-of-ancien-régime">Conclusions of <em>Ancien
Régime</em></h4>
<p>Deeply unequal structures and mostly rural society.</p>
<p>BUT society was on the move:</p>
<ul>
<li>demographic expansion</li>
<li>economic expansio nand innovation</li>
<li>new ideas began to spread: Enlightment ideas
<ul>
<li>mounting criticism of patrician priviliges, of church authority</li>
<li>demands for several freedoms</li>
</ul></li>

<h4 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h4>
<p>struggles for modern liberal democracy and economic liberalism
against <em>Ancien Régime</em> a revolutionary period lasting half
century</p>
<p>Key events: American revolution and independence has inspired Swiss
political regime. French invasion during Napoleonic wars.</p>
<h4
id="switzerland-during-the-revolutionary-and-napoleanonic-wars-1789-1815">Switzerland
during the Revolutionary and Napoleanonic wars (1789-1815)</h4>
<p>In 1798 France invaded Old Confederation, and it became Helvetic
Republic as a “satelite state” of France.</p>
<p>Some people in Old Confederation saw France invasion as a positive
thing, because of the change of mindset.</p>
<p>The invasion was done with some help of revolutionaries, and a
paradox emerges - country unified by the foreign power.</p>
<p>After 1798 invasion republic became more equal system, more cantons
were founded. By 1802 only cantons remained.</p>
<h4 id="turning-point---1815">Turning point - 1815</h4>
<p>Battle of Waterloo - defeat of Napoleon.</p>
<p>Switzerland was perceived as a great power as a buffer zone between
Austrian empire and start of Swiss neutrality during Paris and Vienna
Peace treaties.</p>

<p>There is not one president in Switzerland. There are 7 Federal

<h3 id="cultural-diversity---two-major-dimensions">Cultural diversity -
two major dimensions</h3>
<p>Small country, vut important cultural diversity</p>
<p>Religion - protestant vs catholic</p>
<p>Linguistic - german, italian, french, romansch</p>
<h4 id="religious-cleavages">Religious cleavages</h4>
<p>Main cities of CH happened turned protestant 16th century</p>
<p>Only few other cantons (primitive ones) remained catholic</p>
<p>Mid 19th century around 40% of the population was catholic. And in
1847 the Sonderbund war was fought between the catholics and the
protestants. After the civil war, protestants could impose the federal
constitution in 1848</p>
<p>There was a <strong>kulturkampf</strong> (cultural struggle) during
the second half of the 19th century. Religious issues stemmed from
education - catholic cantons had schools given by the church, protestant
cantons - state schools</p>
<p>And the religious divergence declined in the last part of the 19th
century, and there was a reform of the federal Constitution of 1874 and
election of a catholic conservative federal council</p>
<p>Today the religious issue is much less relevant.</p>
<p>In the recent times, proportion of “No Affiliation” grew in the last
30 years.</p>
<h4 id="linguistic-cleavages">Linguistic Cleavages</h4>
<p>Much less dividing political issue during the 19th century.</p>
<p>The German speaking part represents a clear majority, but other
languages hold the other ~40%</p>
<p>(1950-1970s there was a big immigration from Italy) - this was a time
of major economic growth of Switzerland</p>
<p>Linguistic cantonal autonomy is guaranteed by the constitutional
principle of <strong>teritoriality</strong> - means each canton is
responsible for the use of its language in the canton. It’s used to
protect the linguistic minority in the canton</p>
<p>3 official bilingual cantons - FR, BE, VS, and trilingual canton -
Grisons</p>
<p><strong>Linguistic tensions/difficulties</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>failed integration - Jura Canton (26th canton, created 1979)
<ul>
<li>initially part of Bern, then separatist movement (by French
minority) to create a new canton. There was a division between French
separatists and French-speaking loyalists (who wanted to stay in Bern).
So there was a Jura Canton created without one of the communities that
stayed in Bern.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recent period - new tensions
<ul>
<li>“Rostigraben” since 1992 - separation of the rosti (a potato
dish).</li>
<li>This was the issue from the vote of joining the European Economic
Area, where there was a half divide - 49.7 for (concentrated in French
speaking, and Basel city+outside), 50.3 against (in popular vote) -
6+2/2 for and 14+4/2 against. The rest of the German part and Ticcino
refused to join.</li>
<li>This is influenced by the perception of EU from the Swiss people.
French population had a more positive outlook, and the German-speaking
part were more sceptical about EU, and the influence of Germany.</li>
<li>10 years later there was a bilateral agreement between the EU and
Switzerland. One central part is the free movement of people to work in
either area.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Also - a debate on what second language taught at school should be.
The usual - German for French-speaking, French for German-speaking.
There were tensions when some cantons voted to have Englsih before
French</p>
<p><strong>How do Swiss people communicate with each other</strong>: one
person switches to the language of the other (in the informal context) -
relatively rare because you need to be fluent in both languages</p>
<p>Each person speaks their language and is supposed to understand the
other language (very often the case in formal contexts, and the national
or intercantonal levels)</p>
<p>Or the speak English (… but are not proud of it) e.g. in scientific
national meetings of politics or something else</p>
<p>The people do not really know each other in other cantons</p>

<h4 id="how-it-was-built">How it was built</h4>
<p>The political unification in 1848, made emergence for common
sentiments (political) of nationhood</p>
<p><strong>Major political institutions, which favored political
integration</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Federalism</li>
<li>Proportional representation</li>
<li>Direct democracy</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="federalism">Federalism</h3>
<p>Federalism was a <em>institutional compromise</em> between both sides
in 1848</p>
<p>There are 3 levels to Swiss democracy - Federal, Cantonal, and
Communcal levels</p>
<p>Built with a bottom-up construction - Subsidiarity principle</p>
<p><strong>Communes</strong> - have limited power to organize
themselves, have government and parliament or citizens assembly; are
financially strong (~25% of tax revenue)</p>
<p><strong>Cantons</strong> - have power to organize themselves (own
constitutions), have paraliaments, governments and courts; Implement
their own but also most of federal laws; are financially strong (~40% of
tax revenue)</p>
<p><strong>Bicameral Legislature/Parliament</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>National Council (200 seats)</li>
<li>Council of States (46)</li>

<p>Proportional representation favors small parties and is more

<p>“country of direct democracy”</p>
<p>In no other country, direct demacracy has such a <strong>structuring
impact</strong> on national politics.</p>
<p><strong>There are three different instruments</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Compulsory referendum</strong> for constitutional amendment
and important international treaties (1848 and 1977)</li>
<li><strong>Optional referendum</strong> every decision by the
Parliament can be brought to the poll if 50k citizens sign the
referendum within 100 days (1874)</li>

<p>Popular initative - innovative dimension, also openness of Swiss
political system and favorable to changes</p>
<p><strong>Indirect impact</strong> of the initiative - impulses for
partial reforms in the direction of the goals of the initiative
(e.g. counter-proposal by Federal Council)</p>
<h4 id="optional-referendum">Optional referendum</h4>
<p><strong>Referendum</strong> - veto dimension, braking reforms,

<p>There were numerous tensions between protestants and catholics in
19th cetury</p>
<p>1848-1891 - several successful referendums launched by Catholic
conservatives against proposals by the majoritarian
Radical-protestants</p>
<p>Declining importance of religious issues during the last quarter of
the 19th century resulted in the first catholic-conservative in the
Federal Council (1891)</p>
<h4 id="class-struggle---political-integration">Class struggle -&gt;

<p>After religion in the 19th century, class conflict became the most
salient political cleavage. Numerous social conflicts at the beginning
of the 20th century - <strong>General Strike of 1918</strong></p>
<p>From political tensions to political stability/integration:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>progressive pacification of labor relations (“Labor peace

<h4 id="participation-rate">Participation rate</h4>
<p>It was 46.6% this year.</p>
<p>Why is it low?</p>
<p>Swiss regularly go to vote (There are around 4 voting times per
year.), and if they are not satisfied with the parliament, they can
express their vote in the referendums.</p>
<p>Because of the stability of the political climate, people are not
inclined to vote.</p>
<p>But this time it does not really apply, because it was the first time
former christian democrats, now le centre overtook the radicals (by one
seat). And because of that, they can ask for one more seat in the
government at the cost of radicals seat.</p>
<h4
id="which-parties-can-be-considered-as-the-winnerslosers-of-the-elections-2023">Which
parties can be considered as the winners/losers of the elections
2023?</h4>
<p>Le centre could be considered winners, because of the overtaking of
radicals.</p>
<p>The green parties lost some seats at the cost of Swiss People’s
Party. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of energy resources in Europe</li>
<li>the war in Ukraine affecting the energy prices.</li>
<li>Also, that the demonstrations of green militants generated some
anger among swiss citizens who didn’t want to vote for them
anymore.</li>
<li>The main topics of the campaign were not about day-to-day citizen
problems (inflation)</li>
<li>other parties also include some elements of climate/environment
preoccupation ideas in their programs</li>
<li>there could be a correlation with the fact that greens had more
pro-european agenda, and swiss people party had anti-european
agenda.</li>
</ul>
<p>One reason for the radical democratic party bad result is bancrupcy
of Credit Suisse, which was closely related to the party.</p>
<h4 id="what-were-their-main-arguments">What were their main
arguments?</h4>
<h4 id="what-can-explain-these-results">What can explain these
results?</h4>
<p>Why swiss people’s party is first?</p>
<ul>
<li>conservative attitude</li>
<li>increase of immigration</li>
<li>uncertainty of world political climate</li>
<li>during the crises the tendancy is that right-wing gets more
popularity</li>
</ul>
<p>Long term evolution is that main parties - radicals, soc-democrats,
and christians were main ones from 1920s to 1990s, then right-wing
dropped when swiss people’s party got more votes with a slight decline
of soc-democrats, and then the greens came into the mix.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-the-composition-of-the-parliament-not-complete-yet">Why
is the composition of the Parliament not complete yet?</h4>
<p>There are still second rounds for some cantons, e.g. Vaud. For the
council of states (where there are 2 seats per canton). You need an
absolute majority to get elected.</p>
<p>For the proportional election of the national council, there are no
second rounds.</p>
<h4
id="will-this-new-composition-affect-the-election-of-the-federal-council-next-december">Will
this new composition affect the election of the Federal Council next
December?</h4>
<p>There are 2 rules that are clashing:</p>
<ul>
<li>no residing federal councilor can be removed, and it only can happen
if they resign themselves. Ignaccio Cassis (from radical party) does not
have a high popularity, so they might be pressured to resign.</li>
<li>The centre has more seats than radical right. (but the leader of the
party has already said that they will not attack the swiss people’s
party seat)</li>
</ul>
<p>So no, it will not.</p>
<p><strong>How does Federal Council election take place</strong>: it
takes place every 4 years after the general election (after the second
round as well). (in some cases there is a federal councelor who resigns
during the term). During a year of general election, some old federal
councelor resigns before the election to drive attention to the new
candidates. Every individual is elected one after another, from the
oldest to the youngest/newest.</p>
<p><strong>Who elects the federal council</strong>: federal assembly -
(national council and federal council). You need a majority to get a
seat at the federal council, so there can be negotiations.</p>
<p>In 2003, a councelor was not reelected, and Swiss people’s party
gained a seat.</p>
<p>In 2007, “the night of the long knife” happened, Swiss people’s party
gained seats at the national council, but majority did not reelect one
of their federal council representative. Instead they elected not the
leader of the Swiss people’s party, but less right-winged, unknown woman
that was not even in the parliament. When she accepted the election, she
got kicked out by her party (because she betrayed her party), and
resigned after 2 electoral cycles.</p>
<h4 id="is-there-any-limit-for-money-to-spend-on-ads">Is there any limit
for money to spend on ads?</h4>
<p>2 years ago there was no regulation on funding and transparency of
the campaigning.</p>
<p>Now there is a law that regulates funding of the political campaign
for the election and for the popular votes. Subsidies of more than 5 or
10k CHF, have to be public. (e.g. Philipp Morris subsidized radical
party and swiss people’s party)</p>

<h3 id="role-of-interest-groups-in-swiss-politics">Role of interest
groups in Swiss politics</h3>
<p>One important thing - business associations and economic interest
groups were organized very early in Swiss politics (even before some
parties).</p>
<p>Major economic interest groups:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Economiesuisse (1870) - was even called an 8th federal council</li>
<li>USAM (1879) - Swiss Association of Small business</li>
<li>Swiss farmers’ association (1897)</li>
<li>Swiss Federation of Trade Unions (1880)</li>
</ol>

<p>Other interest groups - consumer organizations, environmental
groups.</p>
<h4 id="why-are-these-groups-so-influential">Why are these groups so
influential?</h4>
<p>These groups usually have bigger financial resources than the

policies or their fields.</p>
<p>These groups have close implecation in political decsion-making
process (pre-parliamentary phase)</p>
<p>Weakness of political parties and late/unachieved professionalisation
of the Parliament (kind of “militia Parliament”) - there was no way to

Economy of Switzerland: The Rise of a “Small Economic Power”</h2>
<h3 id="rise-of-small-economic-power">Rise of “small economic
power”</h3>
<p>Despite its smallness, Switzerland has become a medium size economic
power: 0.012% of world population, but 1.8% world trade (2010).</p>
<p>When did it become one of the wealthiest nations? It had a lot of
emigration, and now immigration.</p>
<p>The emergence of Swiss economic growth was initially in the second
half of the 19th century and then in the first half (WW1 and 2) of the
20th century it grew very fast.</p>
<p>Many Swiss left to the US and South America looking to earn better
living - there was a lot of emigration. The change from emigration to
imigration mainly happened in the second half of 19th century. Numerous
swiss companies were created by immigrants. For example, Rolex was
created by an English-German, Nestle by German man, ABB - founded by
Brown (English) and Boveri (German), merged with Swedish Asea (it is an
engineering firm)</p>
<h4 id="brief-history-background">Brief history background</h4>
<p>Early-industrial revolution - (proto-industrialization) during 18th
century (textile + watch industry) Second industrial revolution (end of
19th century) - machine and chemical industry (swatch, Schindler
elevators, Shultze, Zurich insurance company)</p>
<p>The Financial place started beginning of the 20th century (WW1) (also
every canton has a publicly-owned bank)</p>
<p>Few natural resources - import of raw materials transformed in high
value-added products One of the natural resources - water - known as
fountain of Europe (from which hidroelectric plants).</p>
<p>At the begining Swiss industry didn’t have any pattents in world
technologies, so the companies relied on the immitation of German or
English pattents. Once the companies became mature and experts in their
fields, Switzerland introduced federal pattent law (to protect
themselves) and then Switzerland became the inovation country.</p>
<p>Looking through history: Manufacturing secotr was the biggest one
from the end of 19th century to mid 20th, where it was overtaken by
service sector and the agriculture declined to 2%.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="a-brief-hitory-of-swiss-banking">A brief hitory of Swiss
banking</h3>
<p>Balance sheet - total amount to measure the size of the sector</p>
<p>Until WW1, there is a slight but minimal increase of the sector,
related to the GDP growth as a whole. After the WW1 it grows until WW2,
it grows but not something special.</p>
<p>Starting from the end of WW2, there is a constant growth until 1973
(oil crisis) - “Golden Age of Banking”, and then there is a constant
growth until 1990.</p>
<h4 id="golden-agae-1945---1973">Golden agae (1945 - 1973)</h4>
<p>Why does the sector take off here? After WW2, the attractiveness of
the Swiss financial center can be explined by these factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>the neutrality of the country</li>
<li>infrastructures were preserved from the war</li>
<li>Strong Swiss Franc</li>
<li>Low level of inflation</li>
<li>Political regime favoring liberal policies and an accommodating
taxation system (there was lower taxes in Switzerland than other
countries)</li>
<li>Bank secrecy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bank secrecy</strong> - it’s not new at 1945, it was there
from end of 19th century. Bank will not communicate to the tax
authorities if a client opens an account. This became a law (article 47)
in 1934 - there is a guarantee of conidentiality regarding bank accounts
held by foreign clients; and that any individual working for a bank
regulated by Swiss law who discloses confidential information about the
financial information of a client will face criminal charges.</p>
<p>This constructs the perception of Switzerland as a tax haven.</p>
<p>Bank secrecy attracted major inflow of foreign capital shortly after
WW2. Popular idea promoted by the Swiss Bankers association - that bank
secrecy is aimed at protecting any citizen. Also there was a legend that
this law was passed to protect jews. Actually, it was passed because
French government pushed the Swiss government to know which French
citizens have how much money. This law was very powerful until G20 in
2000s where countries started pushing Switzerland for the tax
information. It is quoted as the end of Bank Secrecy.</p>
<p>In this time there is a growing number of foreign banks - big growth
~1950s-1973, which is mainly due to bank secrecy and other factors.
(more European banks) It was so much money coming in Switzerland, where
the banks had a problem with inflow of money to Switzerland.</p>
<p>Eventually, a law was passed for foreign banks to get a license to
opperate in Switzerland.</p>
<h4 id="from-golden-age-to-globalization-1973---today">From Golden Age
to Globalization (1973 - today)</h4>
<p>Regional banks were the dominant group of banks in the early 20th
century. (had almost 50% of the balance sheet total in 1900)</p>
<p>This group faced competition from cantonal baks, which are under
public law, that became the dominant group after the 1930s. (Advantage:
the presence of tthe state means that <em>all deposits were
guaranteed</em>)</p>
<p>The big banks took over in the 1960s. They started competing
domestically with other banks, and internationally by opening branches
abroad. These banks had to become big to compete with other banks
internationally</p>
<h4 id="globalization-1973---today">Globalization (1973 - today)</h4>
<p>A movement of deregulation, reducing state restrictions to access
markets abroad, transformed the main financial centers</p>
<p>The rise of big banks - A more aggressive approach to compete with
international banks Big banks started to:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop wealth management activities and investment banking</li>
<li>go international (In 1970, there were only 7 branches of Swiss banks
abroad. In 2010, the number had risen to 144 )</li>
<li>Develop closer links with the insurance sector</li>
<li>Absorb smaller local/national banks in order to control the national
market</li>
</ul>
<p>The banking concentration reshaped the structures of the Swiss
financial centre. There were 421 regional baks in 1900 and 60 in 2022.
Local financial centres almost disappeared</p>
<p>625 banks in 1990 -&gt; 239 in 2022.</p>
<p>Big banks themselves are absorbed by others - 6 big banks in the
early 20th century -&gt; 1 in 2024.</p>
<p>The concentration question has been discussed by FIDMA (banking
authority) and competition authority says that Credit Suisse clients
should not go to UBS and go to other banks.</p>
<p>The rise of Credit Suisse and UBS thorugh multiple mergers and
acquisitions. Acceleration of the internationalization of the big banks
was in the 1990s. Credit Suisse for the last years was very much
american and based in New York. And now Credit Suisse is merged into
UBS.</p>

over time in the commercial banks.</p>
<h4 id="role-of-education">Role of education</h4>
<p>Vocational education (VE) - apprenticeship - has 3 distinct
phases.</p>
<p>1890-1910 VE was a dominant pattern -&gt; apprenticeship abroad was a
common pattern among bankers</p>
<p>1937-1980 Dual pattern - VE and University degree were half-half
popular</p>
<p>2000-2020 Strong decline of VE - due to globalization university
degree became more popular.</p>
<h4 id="role-of-the-army">Role of the army</h4>
<p>There was a growth and decline of bankers holding a military rank
corresponds to a period of milatarization - during Idiology of
“Spiritual Defense” in the 1930s-1960s. This was as protection from
foreign influences (“Alps fortress”)</p>
<p>Holding a military rank among elites from the coordinated national
network was a sign of patriotism, and thus satisfying the ideology.</p>
<p>As the netwrok and the ideology declined with the rise of
glovalization, the military rank became an outdated characteristic of
the Swiss bankers.</p>

<h2 id="immigration-and-immigration-policies-in-switzerland">IMMIGRATION
AND IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN SWITZERLAND</h2>

Europe.</p>
<p>In the last 60 years, 6 million migrants have entered Switzerland
with a permit (4 out of 5 went back)</p>
<p>Without any immigration after 1950, the Swiss population would be a
third smaller (bigger proportion than US, AUS, CAN)</p>
<p>Immigration is the main contribution to demographic growth (2.5 times
more immigrations than births) -&gt; most important drive behind
growth</p>
<h3 id="when-economy-meets-direct-democracy">When economy meets direct
democracy</h3>
<p>Economy has relied on the import of labour from mid-19th century.</p>
<p>This economic engine relying on the immigration, has allowed to have
xenophobic tensions that could be expressed politically (more and
earlier than elsewhere) through direct democracy.</p>
<h3
id="historical-evolution-of-immigration-and-immigration-policy">Historical
evolution of immigration and immigration policy</h3>
<p>Switzerland was relatively poor country until mid-19th century and
<strong>emigration</strong> was very prevalent (to Europe, US or South
America)</p>
<p>One of the big exports of Switzerland from 16th century onwards was
mercenaries (pike fighters) - one of the forms of emigration, and was
profitable (still exists as Swiss Guard of Vatican). Mid-19th century
mercenaries was privatized because of the interference with
neutrality.</p>
<p>Quite a bit of people would emigrate to the US or South America.
There are remnants of that - Berne in Indiana, and other colonies
(Colonia Suiza in Uruguay). Due to farmers not wanting to move to the
cities and they were leaving to other countries to farm.</p>
<p>Until 1880s more people were leaving Switzerland than arriving.</p>
<p>1850 onwards - economic takeoff -&gt; labour was too scarce in
Switzerland and weak uniions, weak mobility of peasants (they were
leaving) and “import” of labour from Italy and Germany.</p>
<p>The need for the workforce was from factories and big infrastructure
projects (e.g. Gotthard tunnel which was built by Italian workers)</p>
<p>Before WW1 there was already big proportion of immigrants, and then
it decreases after it because of the closed off policies. From 1950s
there is a very big economic growth and proportion of immigrants growth.
It was driven by an increase in demand of Swiss products. There was also
work permit structure which allowed a lot of immigrants to come and
leave (but strict, yet flexible) - you come if you have a job, and you
can stay only as long as you have a job. Source countries of the
immigrant countries were further than initially - Italy, then Spain,
Portugal, Yugoslavia (these were chosen only when seens as “culturally
compatible”).</p>
<p>In 1960s there was an emergence of xenophobic groups after massive
increase in immigration. Groups were using direct democracy to limit
immigration. Government introduced a quota system because it was put
under pressure</p>
<p>In 1970s, during a recession, there was a big immigrant population
decline because of the work permits flexibility - they had to leave if
they were made redundant. Between 1973 and 1976 Switzerland lost 330,000
jobs and GDP declined by more than 7%. Unemployment increased by only
20,000, and 245,000 were immigrants who were forced to leave the
country. And others were women who stopped their carreers.</p>
<p>In 1991, unemployment couldn’t be exported anymore because the work
permits were made more permanent, and the social guarantees were
introduced. Immigrants were harder hit by crisis because they were more
often low-skilled -&gt; unemployment. Also, there was an opening for EU
workers, and pressure from EU to phase out the work permit system, and
to be open for immigrant workers and free movement. Even though
Switzerland wanted to keep the control of immigration.</p>
<h3 id="immigration-and-the-labour-market">Immigration and the labour
market</h3>
<p>Currently the biggest share of immigrants are from European
countries, whereas other countries have immigrants from African/South
American countries. This is related to the “cultural compatability”</p>
<p>There is a selectivity for the immigration - it’s easy to come from
Portugal due to free movement therefore there are way bigger proportion
with lower education, whereas if a person is comming from outside the
EU, it is very likely that the person is going to be high-skilled.</p>
<p>Swiss people are clearly more probable to get higher salaries than
immigrants even in the higher deciles.</p>
<p>Comparison of income (controlled for age and education) - Swiss men
earn more than foreign men, where Swiss women earn just marginally more
than foreign women. If it is controlled for age and gender, there is no
significant difference in the salaries.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-swiss-neutrality">History of Swiss neutrality</h2>
<p>Swiss neutrality is the result of a complex historical process</p>
<p>Process results from both <em>external pressures</em> and
construction of a <em>national identity</em></p>
<p>Swiss neutrality is very roughly defined and varies</p>
<p>Neturality can be a “moral shield” used to dissimulate the “sword of
trade”</p>
<h3 id="neutrality-before-1815">Neutrality before 1815</h3>
<p>One origin of Swiss wealth is related to Swiss mercenaries</p>
<p><strong>Myth</strong> - Battle of Marignano(1515) led to the birth of
Swiss neutrality. The battle led to temporary end of confederate
expansionist policy and the mercenaries still continued to work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Neutrality</strong> within the meaning of international law
means no military participation in an armed conflict between other
states.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since each canton remained sovereign in matters of foreign affairs -
neutrality cannot be really considered common policy before 1848</p>
<p>And far from being isolated, the old confederation was involved in
the startedgies of European powers; it also offered its services to
either side - which is not really a defininition of neutrality</p>
<h3 id="ww1---fragile-construction-of-neutrality">1815-WW1 - fragile
construction of neutrality</h3>
<h4 id="section">1815</h4>
<p>Swiss neutrality was established in parallel to the emergence of
Modern Switzerland. It was done so on the impulse of foreign powers
(when the cantons collaborated)</p>
<p>Major milestone - 1815 Vienna Congress: Napoleon was defeated in
Battle of Waterloo, and Switzerland was one of the discussion points
whether Switzerland will be still a vassal state of France. It was
agreed that Switzerland’s perpetual neutrality was “in the interests of
the common good” Then the Paris Treaty was signed on November</p>
<p>Consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent and armed neutrality: no temporary neutrality, and allowed
to have an army for defence</li>
<li>Inviolability of Swiss territory is guaranteed</li>
<li>Voluntary neutrality (paradoxal because of the foreign powers, and
Switzerland accepted that)</li>
<li>Switzerland’s neutrality was recognised under international law for
the first time</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Very superficial (and ambiguous) definition of neutrality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This still allowed the Switzerland’s mercenary activity and trade of
weapons of war.</p>
<h4 id="neutrality-introduced-in-the-swiss-constitution">1848 -
neutrality introduced in the Swiss Constitution</h4>
<p>It is not in the fundamental articles</p>

<p>Rights of neutral states - inviolability of a neutral state’s
territory</p>
<p>Duties:</p>
<ul>
<li>refrain from engaging in war</li>
<li>ensure equal treatment for belligerent states in respect of the
exportation of war material (so both sides get the same treatment)</li>
<li>not supply mercenary troops to belligerent states</li>
<li>not allow belligerent staes to use its territory</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ww1">WW1</h4>
<p>Switzerland was surrounded by nations at war</p>
<p>The neutrality was not very consensual among elites, and it was
questioned what Switzerland should do.</p>
<p>People in French side wanted Switzerland to go to war together with
France and Italy People in German side wanted Switzerland to go to war
together with Germany and Austria-Hungary Remaining - wanted
neutrality</p>
<p>It remained neutral.</p>
<p>For the first time there was critisism (local and external) of Swiss
neutrality</p>
<p>Neutrality does not forbid to sell weapons but you have to do equal
trading with both sides.</p>
<p>Switzerland became major financial centre at that time due to
neutrality.</p>
<p>And after the war, Switzerland was intact and it became more obvious
that it’s good for the country to be neutral</p>
<p>At that time it has emerged the image of Switzerland of humanitarian
aid. It was kind of a propaganda aimed to foreign countries and local
citizens (to put together the different opinions). This is related to
the narative of Switzerland developing its own path (isolated and
different from others), and narative of humanitarian aid. On the other
side there was harsh criticism. Such as for Switzerland was selling
ammunition to country at war and providing healing aid to the other
side.</p>
<h4 id="interwar-period">Interwar period</h4>
<p>Treaty of Versailles (1919) - there was a ban on arms production in
Germany</p>
<p>Switzerland as a territory for offshore production -&gt; German arm
production was moved to Switzerland. During Interwar period there was no
governmental control of production of war material.</p>
<p>In 1920 Switzerland joined the League of Nations which created
“differential neutrality” <strong>Differential neutrality</strong> -
Switzerland was not complied to adopt military sanctions as a member of
League of Nations, only the economic sanctions</p>
<h3 id="ww2-and-the-rise-of-criticism-against-neutrality">WW2 and the
rise of criticism against neutrality</h3>
<h4 id="ww2">WW2</h4>
<p><strong>Myth</strong> - Switzerland was not invated thanks to its
strong army and its neutrality.</p>
<p>Actually - Switzerland went back to integral neutrality in 1938, and
in 1939 neutrality was recognized by Hitler. This was because
Switzerland became useful to Nazi Germany during WW2, because it was the
main hub for gold from Germany and the countries occupied by the
Wehrmacht. Switzerland also exported 60% of produced weapons to Germany
because of raw material such as gold. Why?:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because Reichsmark was not convertable anymore, and the
Swiss frank was strong currency</li>
<li>Gold transactions were in 3 phases:
<ul>
<li>First: the transactions were with commercial banks (1939-1941)</li>
<li>Second: Swiss national banks were doing transactions - there was
criticism from alies that Switzerland allowed Germany to trade and in
1942 Switzerland closed its borders to Jewish refugees. And that gold
that was transacted was stolen by the Germans from other countries.</li>
<li>Third - 1944-1945 was big decline of purchases, and increase of
trade with other countries.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>By the 90s there was a big criticism and there was an independent
commission to analyze the trades of Switzerland during the war (the
experts even were allowed to bank archives)</p>
<p>Federal Councillor Marcel Pilet-Golaz was forced to resign because he
was very neutral to the Nazi Germany and fashist regime</p>
<h4 id="consequences-of-ww2">Consequences of WW2</h4>
<p>Collaboration with Axis was strongly criticized by the Allied
powers.</p>
<p>March 8 1945 - end of Swiss trade with Germany and seizure of German
assets by the US. This was because Switzerland wanted to restore its
image with allies and especially US.</p>
<p>Switzerland was isolated on the international scene.</p>
<h3 id="cold-war-period">Cold war period</h3>
<p>Max Petitpierre (foreign minister from 1944 for 15 years) introduced
the new doctrine of <strong>“Neutrality, solidarity and
universality”</strong></p>
<h4 id="neutrality-solidarity-and-universality">Neutrality, solidarity
and universality</h4>
<p>Political neutrality - non-adhesion to the UN (joined just only in
2002) or NATO</p>
<p>Solidarity - good offices (means to serve as mediation during
international conflicts), humanitarian aid and technical assistance to
the “Third World”</p>
<p>Universality - no discrimination among countries (not take into
account the political systems of those conuntries) Reality - Switzerland
was aligned with western and anti-communist countries. Also, there was a
Washington agreement for Switzerland to repay the damages caused during
WW2 to US</p>
<p>Switzerland protective power mandates: as part of solidarity,
Switzerland became an intermediary for Cuba conflicts, Suez crisis,
Iran-Irack conflict, and fall of the Berlin wall. This was mainly
prominent during 1950-2004, and it declined during 1990-2000s because of
the end of the Cold War</p>
<p>This overall worked to repair the image of Switzerland.</p>
<h4 id="biafra-war">Biafra war</h4>
<p>Nigeria became independent in 1960 and was divided in 3 sections.
Biafra declared independence and the country evolved into the country.
It was very mediatized war, and Switzerland decided to launch a big
humanitarian campaign through Red Cross to help Biafra. However, there
was a scandal when one Red Cross plain with aid was shot down by
Nigeria, and the weapons to shoot down the plain were supplied by
Switzerland.</p>
