# Pub golf

## Rules

**Par** - Each bar has a score assigned to it. This score means how many sips the team should have, and if they have less sips than the par, they get negative score (good), and if they have more, they get positive score (bad), otherwise they get a 0. Example: hole 3 is a par 2, which means that the team should take 2 sips in total. Say team takes 3 sips, they get a +1.

## Penalties

1. **Bathroom break** - going to the bathroom will result with a **+2** for the team
2. **Falling down** - tripping and falling down will result with a **+2** for the team
3. **Cheating** - trying to spill a drink or somehow cheat results with a **+5** for the team
4. **Skip** - skipping a hole results with a **+2**
5. **Spillage is lickage** - if the drink is spilled, the team receives **+2** unless the person who spilled the drink licks up the drink.
