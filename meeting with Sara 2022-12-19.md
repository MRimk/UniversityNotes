# STORM x CS Department meeting 2022-12-19

## Borrels

STORM will provide services if the building where they want to do the borrel is reachable through the tunnels (WN, HG) and if it is possible to leave borrel stuff over the next day if the event is late (tunnels close at 17). STORM would need to be paid for at least 2 people (2*7,5 per hour + BTW). We will try to manage to make it to NU building for Alumni Spotlight talks (bimonthly)
Mixed drinks can work, but they are quite bulky, so when ordering we would like to know an estimation how many bottles to have. Price would be â‚¬4 + BTW per drink.
Snacks are fine, but frituur only with setup cost + paying for people to do it (same as above).
For now we will not be taking care of pizzas, since that is the current decision of the Borrel committee, but this can also change later.

## Mentoring

*Tenzin is here*
Wednesdays are free from mentoring activities so STORM could have their dedicated day.

From mentoring program - skating event third week (20th) of January and probably will have a valentine's event.

STORM side: Wednesdays and currently only PWC guest lecture 17th of January.

Coordination with Tenzin: google calendar link of STORM activities, sending the planned event list of each month.

Potential idea - STORM x mentoring activities merge in the future. Either creating a committee that does this, but STORM cannot pay their members and the department still would like to pay people to do these activities since it guarantees reliability and delivery. So to explore this idea board and Tenzin (and few other mentoring TAs) need to have a meeting to discuss it in depth.

AP Martynas: whenisgood for Tenzin, the board and Sara.

## Career Fair

February 15th career fair.

To have a better knowldge and maybe get some help, there should be a meeting between Jet and Filip (External Commissioner) to discuss the department experience.

AP Martynas: ask Filip about the list of contacts and then Sara could cross-compare and send the contacts that STORM does not have.
