title: Meeting with Sara and Mentoring Programme 02-24
---

## Mentoring activities overview

### Bachelors

Key points to take away:

- Exam prep - past exams walkthrough or work together with the course
- People would like more exam preps
- People would like more events as halloween or ice skating.

Exam prep is a bit contraversial:
Theory group was angry that this was organized and it is ruining teaching integrity. Their opinion is that instructor should do them.
However some professirs like it.
Sara's opinion on it is that we can keep it, but with asking how we can support them - polite approach.

### Masters

~140 people, 4 mentors.

Slightly different approach: splitting over 3 areas - academic, career and social events.

Academic and career events usually are workshopts (e.g. on git, LaTeX, building your CV, or talk from PhDers).
Social side builds a community and has a lot of internationals.

There are core ~15 students that attend every event.

Master mentors programme does not really want to be merged immediately as bachelor is, since there are more introverted people there and they have these facese who are already familiar.
However, Sara disagrees and STORM can build such an environment where this would be replicated. Mainly this will change because the department was promoting their programmes at the start of the year and now STORM will be promoted with its programmes.
