title: Meeting with Sara and Mentoring Programme 02-03
---

Sara thinks that it is better not to mix paid and unpaid staff, e.g. have mentors for studying paid, and for activities - no.

This would mean STORM having a committee which would be responsible for such tasks:

- be buddies for first-years
- have study sessions, or guidance for these things

Tenzin would like to have opportunity for current mentors to become mentors in this committee.

STORM would either get money up front or for each event that is organized.

The money would be used to get more first years involved - either meaking the tickets as cheap as possible for them, or free. Or making separate activities to have them together.

Mentors, or committee members could be selected through mentor selection process, but this has to be made very clear to them.
